# Data Override Configuration
# Use this to fix known errors in the Open Data

# Exclude specific entries that have incorrect information
exclude_entries:
  # BORGO TEGOLAIO - Friday entry has wrong section name
  # Friday should be "DA MAZZETTA A VIA DEL CAMPUCCIO" but data shows "DA MICHELOZZI A MAZZETTA"
  # So we exclude the Friday entry for the "DA MICHELOZZI A MAZZETTA" section
  - street_name: "BORGO TEGOLAIO"
    section: "DA MICHELOZZI A MAZZETTA"
    day_code: "VE"  # VE = Venerdì (Friday)
    reason: "Wrong section name - Friday should be DA MAZZETTA A VIA DEL CAMPUCCIO"

  # Add more exclusions here as you discover data errors
  # Example:
  # - street_name: "VIA EXAMPLE"
  #   section: "DA A A B"
  #   day_code: "LU"
  #   reason: "Duplicate entry with wrong day"

# Notes:
# - street_name: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
# - section: Optional - if not specified, matches any section
# - day_code: LU, MA, ME, GI, VE, SA, DO (Italian day abbreviations)
# - reason: Optional - for documentation purposes
